# Spring-Student-Management-System

A student management system that has been developed using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA and a MySQL database. 

As of right now, a user can...
- View a list of their students
- Add a new student
- Delete a student
- Update an existing student

A very simplistic project right now, planning to add more features in the future such as 
- Security/log-in page
- Search bar
- A different user interface for students, perhaps one that shows their course information, Lecturer names etc
- Perhaps an admin role
